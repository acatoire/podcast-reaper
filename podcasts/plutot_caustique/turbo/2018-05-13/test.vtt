02:13.920 --> 02:15.740
Those who have to fear

02:15.740 --> 02:16.540
The plus

02:16.540 --> 02:17.820
It is all the commentators

05:11.140 --> 05:12.460
I am dans une période vide

05:12.460 --> 05:13.140
very strange

05:13.140 --> 05:14.020
I am a little

05:14.020 --> 05:15.240
Not depressed

05:15.240 --> 05:17.340
but la promo is ereintant

05:17.340 --> 05:17.880
very hard

05:17.880 --> 05:19.220
So already on can say that

05:19.220 --> 05:19.440
Bon

05:19.440 --> 05:20.540
There is no pas de la pêche

05:20.540 --> 05:21.080
YES

05:21.080 --> 05:22.680
My

05:22.680 --> 05:24.100
I'm out of my books

05:24.100 --> 05:25.440
in September

05:25.440 --> 05:26.640
August to mid-November

05:26.640 --> 05:27.780
I’m going to pile the opposite.

05:27.780 --> 05:28.280
What I do

05:28.280 --> 05:28.840
When I write

05:28.840 --> 05:30.300
That is, that during one and a half

05:30.300 --> 05:31.040
You are detained

05:31.040 --> 05:31.760
Without seeing anyone

05:31.760 --> 05:32.660
and then

05:32.660 --> 05:33.580
for four months

05:33.580 --> 05:35.220
I have to talk to enormous people

05:35.220 --> 05:35.560
Here is

05:35.560 --> 05:36.700
Here he explains us

05:36.700 --> 05:37.780
Here he explains us

05:37.780 --> 05:38.440
What is hard

05:38.440 --> 05:39.720
The Solitude

05:39.720 --> 05:41.660
by the writer

05:41.660 --> 05:42.060
Finally

05:42.060 --> 05:43.760
It is a beautiful entrance.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.920
in the world of the writer

05:44.920 --> 05:46.300
and after it must make the promo

05:46.300 --> 05:46.740
It is anxious

05:46.740 --> 05:47.300
but attention

05:47.300 --> 05:48.420
It collapses very strongly

05:48.420 --> 05:48.980
Safe that there is

05:48.980 --> 05:49.600
middle of November

05:49.600 --> 05:50.740
J'ai Gagnné Le Prix Fémina

05:50.740 --> 05:51.700
by CUP LA PROMO

05:51.700 --> 05:52.360
Finished Plus

05:52.360 --> 05:53.500
I'm arriving at a stadium

05:53.500 --> 05:54.360
Where I Can't More

05:54.360 --> 05:54.800
to understand

05:54.800 --> 05:55.460
by prononcer

05:55.460 --> 05:56.580
The word serpent

05:56.580 --> 05:58.200
Who must be the title

05:58.200 --> 05:58.800
The Son of the Book

05:58.800 --> 05:59.240
Here is

05:59.240 --> 06:01.140
I talk with an actor

06:01.140 --> 06:01.720
The other day

06:01.720 --> 06:02.820
When they have a movie

06:02.820 --> 06:03.200
by Friday

06:03.200 --> 06:03.880
by les voit partout

06:03.880 --> 06:04.780
But it lasts only a week

06:04.780 --> 06:05.780
We are several months

06:05.780 --> 06:06.780
Meeting with colleagues

06:06.780 --> 06:07.300
to make the salons

06:07.300 --> 06:08.000
and repeat always

06:08.000 --> 06:08.720
I love things

06:08.720 --> 06:09.460
very well

06:09.460 --> 06:10.280
Le mec se plaint

06:10.280 --> 06:10.840
of something

06:10.840 --> 06:11.880
Who is a priori

06:11.880 --> 06:13.220
But quite sympathetic

06:13.220 --> 06:14.020
So far very well

06:14.020 --> 06:15.180
one day

06:15.180 --> 06:16.540
Because we were disputed

06:16.540 --> 06:17.540
The woman was part

06:17.540 --> 06:18.300
See the former son

06:18.300 --> 06:19.040
It was a revenue

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
with the traces of sperm

06:20.040 --> 06:20.660
on the Seins

06:20.660 --> 06:22.360
This makes me a couple

06:22.360 --> 06:23.940
Here is then

06:23.940 --> 06:25.620
It is what can be repeated

06:25.620 --> 06:26.420
then

06:26.420 --> 06:28.160
J'ai pas vu la charnière

06:28.160 --> 06:28.480
The Trick

06:28.480 --> 06:28.780
c is that

06:28.780 --> 06:29.160
and a

06:29.160 --> 06:30.460
So you have well understood

06:30.460 --> 06:31.900
Not forgotten the words

06:31.900 --> 06:34.100
This person a well derapé

06:34.100 --> 06:34.700
of a coup

06:34.700 --> 06:35.920
I talk with an actor

06:35.920 --> 06:36.440
The other day

06:36.440 --> 06:37.120
When they font

06:37.120 --> 06:38.240
The movie on Friday

06:38.240 --> 06:39.740
A few months of promo

06:39.740 --> 06:40.640
Meeting with colleagues

06:40.640 --> 06:41.080
to make the salons

06:41.080 --> 06:42.320
and repeat always

06:42.320 --> 06:42.940
I love things

06:42.940 --> 06:43.480
Point

06:43.480 --> 06:44.180
one day

06:44.180 --> 06:45.860
Because we were disputed

06:45.860 --> 06:47.320
The woman was part

06:47.320 --> 06:48.020
See the former son

06:48.020 --> 06:48.680
It was a revenue

06:48.680 --> 06:49.640
with the traces of sperm

06:49.640 --> 06:50.240
on the Seins

06:50.240 --> 06:51.700
This makes me a couple

06:51.700 --> 06:52.700
I feel again

06:52.700 --> 06:53.800
with the tricks on me

06:53.800 --> 06:55.240
The Morceaux of Serpent

06:55.240 --> 06:55.600
then

06:55.600 --> 06:56.520
It is that you

06:56.520 --> 06:57.500
You don't believe it's right

06:57.500 --> 06:58.420
Serpent and Sperm

06:58.420 --> 06:58.960
who are similar

06:58.960 --> 06:59.800
So he makes an association

06:59.800 --> 07:02.120
I'm never vu but I'm never vu

07:02.120 --> 07:02.580
A Man

07:02.580 --> 07:03.300
already good

07:03.300 --> 07:03.880
good already

07:03.880 --> 07:04.900
It is a writer

07:04.900 --> 07:05.700
It is not a secret

07:05.700 --> 07:06.220
You are a meuf

07:06.220 --> 07:06.680
Yes

07:06.680 --> 07:07.620
Bon moi j'en ai one too

07:07.620 --> 07:09.580
Imaginations that we are enguling

07:09.580 --> 07:10.620
with the respective meufs

07:10.620 --> 07:12.080
Imagination itself

07:12.080 --> 07:13.160
How to see their ex

07:13.160 --> 07:14.800
Admissions

07:14.800 --> 07:15.940
When she returns

07:15.940 --> 07:16.800
All women are free

07:16.800 --> 07:17.720
When she returns

07:17.720 --> 07:19.180
with traces

07:19.180 --> 07:19.820
by sperm

07:19.820 --> 07:20.580
on the Seins

07:20.580 --> 07:21.060
c’est-à-dire

07:21.060 --> 07:22.160
by son chandail

07:22.160 --> 07:23.140
It's all that is all

07:23.140 --> 07:23.600
I understand the pas

07:23.600 --> 07:24.100
Not because that already

07:24.100 --> 07:25.820
That is what I do not understand

07:25.820 --> 07:26.220
already

07:26.220 --> 07:27.540
The traces of the sperm

07:27.540 --> 07:27.900
on the Seins

07:27.900 --> 07:28.700
So already I will have to explain

07:28.700 --> 07:29.640
What’s what’s the traces

07:29.640 --> 07:30.400
Sperm on the Seins

07:30.400 --> 07:30.740
Because that

07:30.740 --> 07:31.700
because it is the sperm seché

07:31.700 --> 07:32.400
by son chandail

07:32.400 --> 07:33.080
Because that is

07:33.080 --> 07:33.560
for example

07:33.560 --> 07:35.260
When on fait l'amour dans le bain

07:35.260 --> 07:35.540
You see

07:35.540 --> 07:36.120
with the water

07:36.120 --> 07:37.220
It remains the little tricks.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.180
I am too big

07:38.180 --> 07:39.140
To make love in the bathroom

07:39.140 --> 07:40.640
When you do the love

07:40.640 --> 07:41.840
I know you know you know you know you know

07:41.840 --> 07:42.400
The Principle

07:42.400 --> 07:43.480
If yes, it is a fact.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.000
once or two

07:44.000 --> 07:46.240
When it is a water

07:46.240 --> 07:47.880
The sperm remains

07:47.880 --> 07:49.280
and faces the little trucs collés

07:49.280 --> 07:49.860
So then that

07:49.860 --> 07:51.360
I sauras no dire

07:51.360 --> 07:51.640
You see

07:51.640 --> 07:52.700
Bon then c'est le seul moyen

07:52.700 --> 07:53.360
because otherwise

07:53.360 --> 07:54.880
as du sel when you sors de la mer

07:54.880 --> 07:55.300
Exactly

07:55.300 --> 07:56.220
Exactly

07:56.220 --> 07:59.180
I am what I'm imagining

07:59.180 --> 08:00.260
It was rather that sa meuf

08:00.260 --> 08:01.120
Part of

08:01.120 --> 08:02.260
Sugar

08:02.260 --> 08:02.760
It has done

08:02.760 --> 08:04.460
The Prime Minister Ex Venu

08:04.460 --> 08:05.720
He who enjoys

08:05.720 --> 08:06.620
by Le Chandail

08:06.620 --> 08:07.660
by le tricot de peau

08:07.660 --> 08:08.400
and that she returns

08:08.400 --> 08:09.280
without being cleaned

08:09.280 --> 08:09.520
to prove to the mec

08:09.520 --> 08:10.380
on the Seins

08:10.380 --> 08:11.420
on the Seins

08:11.420 --> 08:11.940
Yes but c'est possibly les seins

08:11.940 --> 08:12.680
It may be le

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
In any case he

08:13.680 --> 08:14.540
It must not be embroiled

08:14.540 --> 08:15.200
with his wife

08:15.200 --> 08:16.500
I think the disputes

08:16.500 --> 08:17.580
The coup must be private

08:17.580 --> 08:18.000
Because that

08:18.000 --> 08:18.720
You pass me the sel

08:18.720 --> 08:20.000
You talk not like that.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.020
Bon je vais sucer le bazar

08:22.020 --> 08:24.420
then already

08:24.420 --> 08:25.860
The ex must be available

08:25.860 --> 08:26.440
of course

08:26.440 --> 08:27.800
You need to know where it is

08:27.800 --> 08:28.780
at any moment

08:28.780 --> 08:29.920
He must have a desire

08:29.920 --> 08:31.000
by se faire sucer

08:31.000 --> 08:32.140
Bon of Agreement

08:32.140 --> 08:34.140
and the end on the seins

08:34.140 --> 08:34.900
and the end on the seins

08:34.900 --> 08:35.640
and to say

08:35.640 --> 08:36.740
You want a serviette

08:36.740 --> 08:37.560
No IRA thank you

08:37.560 --> 08:39.320
I'm going to make my mec

08:39.320 --> 08:39.500
in fact

08:39.500 --> 08:40.260
I think this is the idea

08:40.260 --> 08:41.200
It was to make it crazy

08:41.200 --> 08:43.380
The Woman of This Person

08:43.380 --> 08:43.940
Who a nothing demanded

08:43.940 --> 08:44.760
First Question

08:44.760 --> 08:46.120
It makes the worst analogy of the world

08:46.120 --> 08:46.900
Because we’re d’accord

08:46.900 --> 08:47.880
That already doesn’t mean anything

08:47.880 --> 08:48.440
and what more

08:48.440 --> 08:49.900
It has nothing to see

08:49.900 --> 08:50.720
with the stories

08:50.720 --> 08:51.620
The Strass of Sperm

08:51.620 --> 08:52.400
by La Promo

08:52.400 --> 08:54.120
You feel the sale of your book

08:54.120 --> 08:54.460
Yes

08:54.460 --> 08:56.020
You are defending this analogy

08:56.020 --> 08:56.700
I don't understand anything

08:56.700 --> 08:57.420
no no no no no

08:57.420 --> 08:59.100
And then the second question

08:59.100 --> 09:00.060
The second question

09:00.060 --> 09:00.480
YES

09:00.480 --> 09:01.420
and

09:01.420 --> 09:02.800
Because that

09:02.800 --> 09:03.540
I rappelled you

09:03.540 --> 09:04.540
What it does

09:04.540 --> 09:05.420
This makes me a couple

09:05.420 --> 09:06.200
I feel again

09:06.200 --> 09:06.980
with the tricks on me

09:06.980 --> 09:07.860
The Morceaux of Serpent

09:07.860 --> 09:08.920
I'm so bad to write

09:08.920 --> 09:09.520
forced

09:09.520 --> 09:10.220
after it is true that

09:10.220 --> 09:11.480
You must always think

09:11.480 --> 09:12.000
to your wife

09:12.000 --> 09:12.680
Who becomes tringler

09:12.680 --> 09:13.620
by any crazy

09:13.620 --> 09:14.620
You are not forced in the

09:14.620 --> 09:14.700
of course

09:14.700 --> 09:16.520
Here is the journalist

09:16.520 --> 09:17.600
Not to note

09:17.600 --> 09:19.220
by bah d'accord

09:19.220 --> 09:19.680
Strange

09:19.680 --> 09:20.140
He said

09:20.140 --> 09:20.880
and you prenez

09:20.880 --> 09:21.820
Le mec ne relève pas

09:21.820 --> 09:22.380
no no no

09:22.380 --> 09:23.360
The direct journalist

09:23.360 --> 09:24.220
and you prenez le temps

09:24.220 --> 09:24.520
by lire

09:24.520 --> 09:26.660
by send qu'il essaie

09:26.660 --> 09:27.340
The Escape

09:27.340 --> 09:28.500
No but you see well

09:28.500 --> 09:29.100
The man had to be

09:29.100 --> 09:29.700
Hyper mal à l'aise

09:29.700 --> 09:30.280
Dancing on a sofa

09:30.280 --> 09:30.860
in the salon

09:30.860 --> 09:31.600
by Philippe Jaénada

09:31.600 --> 09:32.820
You are the heads

09:32.820 --> 09:33.860
The Serre Around

09:33.860 --> 09:34.480
You are the Woman

09:34.480 --> 09:34.980
Who looks at you

09:34.980 --> 09:35.640
by the entrebaillure

09:35.640 --> 09:36.080
from the door

09:36.080 --> 09:37.560
You revoulez des gâteaux

09:37.560 --> 09:39.980
If you engueulez

09:39.980 --> 09:40.540
I am here

09:40.540 --> 09:42.560
Philippe’s attention

09:42.560 --> 09:43.420
You are angry

09:43.420 --> 09:45.640
Not the Cake

09:45.640 --> 09:46.040
Selling Pudding

09:46.040 --> 09:46.980
Bon bah je vais sucer le vase

09:46.980 --> 09:47.920
Imagine this site

09:47.920 --> 09:48.380
They have sent

09:48.380 --> 09:49.000
Their internship

09:49.000 --> 09:50.260
This is the little Nico.

09:50.260 --> 09:52.060
Who is a 19 piges

09:52.060 --> 09:52.320
Who is there

09:52.320 --> 09:53.440
with son petit magnetophone

09:53.440 --> 09:54.920
and then he enchaîne

09:54.920 --> 09:55.940
and otherwise

09:55.940 --> 09:57.060
you prenez le temps

09:57.060 --> 09:57.380
by lire

09:57.380 --> 09:58.740
So here you imagine well

09:58.740 --> 09:59.260
What is not good

09:59.260 --> 10:00.020
then here

10:00.020 --> 10:02.460
Spoiler alert

10:02.460 --> 10:03.180
From the end

10:03.180 --> 10:04.680
This second question

10:04.680 --> 10:05.840
Repair of his wife

10:05.840 --> 10:06.460
Who has nothing demanded

10:06.460 --> 10:07.360
who a refait a truc degueu

10:07.360 --> 10:07.920
I am you

10:07.920 --> 10:08.760
Le Zappe Le Beginning

10:08.760 --> 10:09.720

10:09.720 --> 10:10.200
I have the potes

10:10.200 --> 10:10.640
who disent me

10:10.640 --> 10:11.100
When I write

10:11.100 --> 10:11.620
I don’t read

10:11.620 --> 10:12.000
It seems to me

10:12.000 --> 10:12.840
completely mysterious

10:12.840 --> 10:13.640
Here is

10:13.640 --> 10:14.520
by patac tac

10:14.520 --> 10:15.320
We are talking about Bukowski

10:15.320 --> 10:16.500
There is J'ai relu

10:16.500 --> 10:17.220
for the reimpression

10:17.220 --> 10:17.760
in pocket

10:17.760 --> 10:18.600
not here

10:18.600 --> 10:20.620
It says that there is a relu Bukowski

10:20.620 --> 10:21.160
by agreement

10:21.160 --> 10:22.220
He says he loves well

10:22.220 --> 10:23.540
the side completely disinhibed

10:23.540 --> 10:24.920
There is J'ai relu

10:24.920 --> 10:25.560
Because there is a

10:25.560 --> 10:26.060
A reimpression

10:26.060 --> 10:26.500
in pocket

10:26.500 --> 10:27.440
A reimpression

10:27.440 --> 10:28.040
in pocket

10:28.040 --> 10:28.900
Here is

10:28.900 --> 10:31.820
by Nefertiti

10:31.820 --> 10:32.160
Dancing and

10:32.160 --> 10:33.060
No

10:33.060 --> 10:34.400
The Book of Bukowski

10:34.400 --> 10:34.700
Here is

10:34.700 --> 10:36.620
and it rappelle sa femme

10:36.620 --> 10:37.940
because there is a le mot chier

10:37.940 --> 10:39.160
A lot in the book

10:39.160 --> 10:40.400
and there of course

10:40.400 --> 10:40.740
HOP

10:40.740 --> 10:41.180
by direct

10:41.180 --> 10:41.980
He thinks of his wife

10:41.980 --> 10:43.680
because when I’ve met

10:43.680 --> 10:44.120
The Woman

10:44.120 --> 10:44.540
then here

10:44.540 --> 10:45.420
The journalist

10:45.420 --> 10:46.120
being sure

10:46.120 --> 10:46.800
A Fear Again

10:46.800 --> 10:47.540
What it does no matter

10:47.540 --> 10:49.440
It is what you lisez

10:49.440 --> 10:50.340
Yes, I am Bukowski

10:50.340 --> 10:51.600
When I’ve met

10:51.600 --> 10:51.980
The Woman

10:51.980 --> 10:52.480
no no no

10:52.480 --> 10:53.940
It is what you lisez

10:53.940 --> 10:54.880
I am Bukowski

10:54.880 --> 10:55.860
He is talking about Chier

10:55.860 --> 10:56.560
It is a lot of chier

10:56.560 --> 10:57.060
The Ten

10:57.060 --> 10:58.400
That makes me think to the woman

10:58.400 --> 11:00.600
So here on a fear

11:00.600 --> 11:01.660
and you are right

11:01.660 --> 11:02.920
because when I’ve met

11:02.920 --> 11:03.340
The Woman

11:03.340 --> 11:04.160
She’s not arrested

11:04.160 --> 11:04.860
by Allers aux Chiottes

11:04.860 --> 11:05.900
At least 10 times a day

11:05.900 --> 11:06.820
What to?

11:06.820 --> 11:07.720
and to make caca

11:07.720 --> 11:09.820
I liked it

11:09.820 --> 11:10.380
The mixer

11:10.380 --> 11:10.960
and a story of love

11:10.960 --> 11:12.140
I’ve corrected a little.

11:12.140 --> 11:12.880
Therefore

11:12.880 --> 11:13.960
on the east sur

11:13.960 --> 11:14.560
A Man

11:14.560 --> 11:15.540
I invite you anyway.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.840
Go to Chercher a little sa head

11:16.840 --> 11:18.820
on est sur ce petit monsieur

11:18.820 --> 11:20.840
It looks like Benicio Del Toro.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.100
Who would have a little too much

11:22.100 --> 11:23.020
by Benicio del Toro

11:23.020 --> 11:23.920
The Team Seat

11:23.920 --> 11:26.780
Benicio Del Team Seat

11:26.780 --> 11:28.260
Who Would Have Problems with Hormones

11:28.260 --> 11:30.140
sufficiently marked

11:30.140 --> 11:31.480
and the coup it says

11:31.480 --> 11:33.300
by J'ai Lu Bukowski

11:33.300 --> 11:34.680
It is about caca

11:34.680 --> 11:36.280
That me rappelle ma femme

11:36.280 --> 11:37.080
by Ma Femme

11:37.080 --> 11:37.700
What is a chié

11:37.700 --> 11:39.240
At the beginning of our relationship?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.200
may be now

11:40.200 --> 11:40.700
It is arrested

11:40.700 --> 11:41.060
But at the time

11:41.060 --> 11:41.920
It was 10 times a day

11:41.920 --> 11:43.940
How does it conclude?

11:43.940 --> 11:44.180
Because it is necessary

11:44.180 --> 11:45.560
then here

11:45.560 --> 11:46.940
The journalist said

11:46.940 --> 11:47.640
and your wife

11:47.640 --> 11:48.380
She said what?

11:48.380 --> 11:49.540
Oh she's wrong completely

11:49.540 --> 11:50.360
It is Protestant

11:50.360 --> 11:50.900
and alsacienne

11:50.900 --> 11:51.580
in his educations

11:51.580 --> 11:52.840
on a right of everything

11:52.840 --> 11:53.620
The moment that it is true

11:53.620 --> 11:54.460
once

11:54.460 --> 11:55.540
I’ve even written

11:55.540 --> 11:56.460
When she was little

11:56.460 --> 11:57.200
She dreamed of kissing

11:57.200 --> 11:57.920
with son father

11:57.920 --> 11:59.540
and relisant

11:59.540 --> 12:00.200
I am there

12:00.200 --> 12:00.940
I can anyway

12:00.940 --> 12:01.500
Don’t put it

12:01.500 --> 12:02.580
by Benicio Del Toro

12:02.580 --> 12:03.880
and the limits

12:03.880 --> 12:04.420
And then he says

12:04.420 --> 12:04.660
anyway

12:04.660 --> 12:04.900
Here is

12:04.900 --> 12:06.960
What is it a response?

12:06.960 --> 12:07.840
Madame Je Suce Le Voisin

12:07.840 --> 12:08.520
by train de faire caca

12:08.520 --> 12:08.960
It is a dit

12:08.960 --> 12:09.760
Ben what?

12:09.760 --> 12:11.040
Is it true?

12:11.040 --> 12:11.800
She was for

12:11.800 --> 12:12.720
What they disent in the book

12:12.720 --> 12:13.860
What she wants to kiss with son father

12:13.860 --> 12:14.720
This is at the limit

12:14.720 --> 12:15.120
You see

12:15.120 --> 12:16.560
The Complex of Oedipe

12:16.560 --> 12:17.900
Bon c is not new

12:17.900 --> 12:19.360
I am what I'm more surprised

12:19.360 --> 12:20.360
This is the report to la merde.

12:20.360 --> 12:20.840
You see

12:20.840 --> 12:21.700
I want you to say

12:21.700 --> 12:22.620
Why

12:22.620 --> 12:23.900
It is at the beginning of their relationship.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.200
ELLE CHAYIT PLUS THAT NOW

12:25.200 --> 12:26.080
What is that who has passed?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.020
What's What a Change Dance

12:27.020 --> 12:27.800
The stress?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.100
Maybe the new love?

12:29.100 --> 12:29.380
Maybe

12:29.380 --> 12:30.180
She said

12:30.180 --> 12:31.620
I finally meet the man of my life.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.720
It is always that

12:32.720 --> 12:33.100
make gaffe

12:33.100 --> 12:33.720
If you are

12:33.720 --> 12:35.480
people think that it is the diarrhea

12:35.480 --> 12:36.000
and the courant

12:36.000 --> 12:36.600
It’s not love

12:36.600 --> 12:37.180
If it is found

12:37.180 --> 12:38.340
You are in love with someone

12:38.340 --> 12:40.160
I’ve never seen love like that.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.780
But it is true that it is

12:40.780 --> 12:41.880
Therefore

12:41.880 --> 12:43.120
Balance of the Interview

12:43.120 --> 12:43.860
It's what you want to read

12:43.860 --> 12:45.520
The Women’s Prize?

12:45.520 --> 12:45.960
Ben in fact

12:45.960 --> 12:46.780
What I say to me above all

12:46.780 --> 12:47.220
It is that there

12:47.220 --> 12:48.660
on n'en est qu'à la seconde question

12:48.660 --> 12:50.040
What is what happens after

12:50.040 --> 12:51.300
Is that going on?

12:51.300 --> 12:53.160
Is it that le stagiaire a survival?

12:53.160 --> 12:54.500
What are they not sequestre?

12:54.500 --> 12:54.860
What you see

12:54.860 --> 12:55.280
Because that

12:55.280 --> 12:56.320
Party like this

12:56.320 --> 12:58.100
I think we can be easily

12:58.100 --> 12:59.060
A couple of Zinzin

12:59.060 --> 12:59.880
You see the genre

12:59.880 --> 13:01.320
The pub of the staircase

13:01.320 --> 13:01.800
The West Craven

13:01.800 --> 13:02.740
You see where they have children

13:02.740 --> 13:03.660
who vivent dans les murs

13:03.660 --> 13:04.560
You see I know not

13:04.560 --> 13:05.000
I know not

13:05.000 --> 13:06.760
I want to read the suite in any case.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.400
It is a suite

13:07.400 --> 13:08.380
The Interview

13:08.380 --> 13:09.600
So on the East really

13:09.600 --> 13:11.220
It is a rollercoaster.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.060
And there was the top

13:13.060 --> 13:13.920
Here is no better

13:13.920 --> 13:15.000
But finally he talks anyway.

13:15.000 --> 13:15.720
From the end to the end

13:15.720 --> 13:16.480
to say that

13:16.480 --> 13:17.660
They have an apartment

13:17.660 --> 13:18.440
and there is a piece

13:18.440 --> 13:19.760
where she has no right to return

13:19.760 --> 13:22.140
If it is true that it is

13:22.140 --> 13:23.160
Qu'elle chie par terre

13:23.160 --> 13:25.760
How to meet the spu spu

13:25.760 --> 13:26.840
A little everywhere

13:26.840 --> 13:27.980
It is true that I understand

13:27.980 --> 13:29.300
When on a need of son intimacy

13:29.300 --> 13:30.080
I agree but not bad

13:30.080 --> 13:30.760
very nice

13:30.760 --> 13:33.240
Was it in the Society of When?

13:33.240 --> 13:35.520
The Society of the People with Kendrick Lamar

13:35.520 --> 13:37.140
27 February to 7 March

13:37.140 --> 13:38.720
It is a little old

13:38.720 --> 13:39.980
I am trained in les chiottes

13:39.980 --> 13:41.440
I also have a little problem.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
You are also in love

13:42.440 --> 13:44.780
After I am first made the trick

13:44.780 --> 13:45.360
by Mélenchon

13:45.360 --> 13:46.380
by Kendrick Lamar

13:46.380 --> 13:48.240
and puis après j'ai vu ce truc là

13:48.240 --> 13:49.220
I can tell you

13:49.220 --> 13:49.860
That was not the interview

13:49.860 --> 13:50.300
I wanted to read

13:50.300 --> 13:51.140
Because I didn't have who it was

13:51.140 --> 13:52.640
et ben j'ai pas été déçu

13:52.640 --> 13:53.840
You will possibly buy the serpent then

13:53.840 --> 13:55.380
I have lu la serpe.

13:55.380 --> 13:56.320
and what they want to talk

13:56.320 --> 13:57.040
in the comments

13:57.040 --> 13:58.220
on our social networks

13:58.220 --> 13:59.080
says us comment it was

13:59.080 --> 14:01.140
very well

14:01.140 --> 14:01.580
Subject

14:01.580 --> 14:03.200
subject number 2

14:03.200 --> 14:04.620
Listen to me and a trick

14:04.620 --> 14:05.400
Who tracases me a little

14:05.400 --> 14:06.080
The last time

14:06.080 --> 14:09.200
I am tombé on a video

14:09.200 --> 14:11.140
by a German tourist

14:11.140 --> 14:11.860
in Austria

14:11.860 --> 14:13.600
Who

14:13.600 --> 14:14.820
I have the impression that it goes again

14:14.820 --> 14:15.280
Talk about CAC

14:15.280 --> 14:15.820
No

14:15.820 --> 14:17.360
Maybe

14:17.360 --> 14:18.000
and on and viendra

14:18.000 --> 14:18.840
But for the moment not

14:18.840 --> 14:20.140
It is in Austria

14:20.140 --> 14:21.120
with ses potes in vacation

14:21.120 --> 14:22.080
This is his first vacation

14:22.080 --> 14:23.300
And it is a bar

14:23.300 --> 14:24.140
Because he is a supporter

14:24.140 --> 14:25.900
Supporters of Brême

14:25.900 --> 14:27.480
Meeting with the mecs of Bayern

14:27.480 --> 14:27.940
A trick like that.

14:27.940 --> 14:28.180
Shortly

14:28.180 --> 14:30.040
It gets a coup on the ear.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.200
A little problem with the temptation

14:31.200 --> 14:31.840
The doctor says

14:31.840 --> 14:32.760
You can’t take the plane.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.320
You can't get back with your potes

14:34.320 --> 14:35.160
attend a day or two

14:35.160 --> 14:36.640
He attends one day or two

14:36.640 --> 14:37.720
I go to the airport

14:37.720 --> 14:39.440
and here

14:39.440 --> 14:41.800
Video of camera surveillance

14:41.800 --> 14:42.400
We Le Voyons

14:42.400 --> 14:43.380
Returns to the airport

14:43.380 --> 14:44.000

14:44.000 --> 14:45.820
I will see the doctor.

14:45.820 --> 14:46.420
of the airport

14:46.420 --> 14:47.720
to have the confirmation

14:47.720 --> 14:48.760
I have the right to fly

14:48.760 --> 14:50.060
The doctor says

14:50.060 --> 14:50.500
No problem

14:50.500 --> 14:50.880
and here

14:50.880 --> 14:52.520
Camera of Surveillance

14:52.520 --> 14:54.260
I have sacks

14:54.260 --> 14:55.260
on le voit s'enfuir

14:55.260 --> 14:56.460
in the hall of the airport

14:56.460 --> 14:58.300
Out of the airport

14:58.300 --> 14:58.760
in the current

14:58.760 --> 15:00.440
Crossing the Pistes

15:00.440 --> 15:01.560
Escalate and grill

15:01.560 --> 15:02.580
and escape in the forest

15:02.580 --> 15:04.940
and on ne l'a jamais revu

15:04.940 --> 15:05.980
What to?

15:05.980 --> 15:07.060
never revu

15:07.060 --> 15:08.640
It was in 2014

15:08.640 --> 15:10.480
Le mec a disparu

15:10.480 --> 15:12.200
I'm not going to go to Canada

15:12.200 --> 15:13.700
Des gens l'ont vu in Hungary

15:13.700 --> 15:14.140
on it

15:14.140 --> 15:14.800
J'ai vu un Clodo

15:14.800 --> 15:15.360
who he looks like

15:15.360 --> 15:15.980
by bullshit

15:15.980 --> 15:18.040
Reddit a essayé de retrouver le gars

15:18.040 --> 15:20.020
No one is found

15:20.020 --> 15:22.140
You know where it is me?

15:22.140 --> 15:24.160
It is behind you!

15:24.160 --> 15:24.980
Writing of the Books

15:24.980 --> 15:26.080
He was behind you

15:26.080 --> 15:26.600
From the beginning

15:26.600 --> 15:27.960
and then the mec

15:27.960 --> 15:29.580
What I'm Trying Me

15:29.580 --> 15:30.080
A little girl

15:30.080 --> 15:30.500
c is

15:30.500 --> 15:32.320
Good for videos

15:32.320 --> 15:33.120
The video is scared

15:33.120 --> 15:33.320
You see

15:33.320 --> 15:33.780
You are OK

15:33.780 --> 15:34.400
He has fought

15:34.400 --> 15:35.320
before that

15:35.320 --> 15:35.980
A Called Mother

15:35.980 --> 15:36.600
for him to say

15:36.600 --> 15:37.980
I believe I am followed

15:37.980 --> 15:39.540
He was completely paranoid.

15:39.540 --> 15:40.320
It is a dit

15:40.320 --> 15:41.400
Doctors are not filed

15:41.400 --> 15:42.340
A medicine

15:42.340 --> 15:43.900
I think that

15:43.900 --> 15:44.700
It is not normal

15:44.700 --> 15:44.940
and all

15:44.940 --> 15:46.780
What age is this person?

15:46.780 --> 15:47.400
24 pics

15:47.400 --> 15:49.360
but German

15:49.360 --> 15:50.440
So it's a l'air of having 40

15:50.440 --> 15:50.920
No

15:50.920 --> 15:52.060
He was pretty glabry

15:52.060 --> 15:53.340
It was not a beautiful German.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.220
It is not le beau teuton

15:54.220 --> 15:54.840
Shortly

15:54.840 --> 15:56.420
Safe that

15:56.420 --> 15:57.480
The Beau Teuton

15:57.480 --> 15:59.020
where it becomes interesting

15:59.020 --> 16:00.580
The Beau Teuton

16:00.580 --> 16:01.540
where it becomes interesting

16:01.540 --> 16:02.160
c is that

16:02.160 --> 16:03.940
Internet a mené l'enquête

16:03.940 --> 16:05.380
and what the mecs have said

16:05.380 --> 16:06.360
Possibly

16:06.360 --> 16:07.720
It is a coup on the head.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.680
Three days before

16:08.680 --> 16:10.080
Traumatic

16:10.080 --> 16:11.940
Paranoia

16:11.940 --> 16:14.380
due au traumatisme crânien

16:14.380 --> 16:15.940
and the mec was convinced

16:15.940 --> 16:16.720
to be persecuted

16:16.720 --> 16:18.000
on a la video

16:18.000 --> 16:18.420
by him

16:18.420 --> 16:19.080
on a la video

16:19.080 --> 16:20.200
I invite you to go to see

16:20.200 --> 16:21.580
I will say the name to the end.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.280
I have forgotten

16:22.280 --> 16:23.480
by the mec

16:23.480 --> 16:26.300
who crosses the hall in current

16:26.300 --> 16:26.960
Abandoned everything

16:26.960 --> 16:27.360
Son of Sack

16:27.360 --> 16:28.020
His passport

16:28.020 --> 16:28.640
The Son Phone

16:28.640 --> 16:29.180
Son of Argenti

16:29.180 --> 16:29.500
Nothing

16:29.840 --> 16:30.940
and he's retrouve dans les bois

16:30.940 --> 16:32.060
in Austria

16:32.060 --> 16:32.840
by Galie

16:32.840 --> 16:33.020
I know more

16:33.020 --> 16:33.900
I see it in the woods

16:33.900 --> 16:35.000
all alone

16:35.000 --> 16:36.220
and on a plus of news

16:36.220 --> 16:36.460
by him

16:36.460 --> 16:38.160
Sa Mère Allait Le Chercher

16:38.160 --> 16:38.580
on place

16:38.580 --> 16:39.860
They have searched in the streets

16:39.860 --> 16:40.780
The Centres of Clodo

16:40.780 --> 16:41.440
in the Hospitals

16:41.440 --> 16:43.420
What I am asking

16:43.420 --> 16:43.740
c is

16:43.740 --> 16:44.880
According to the doctors

16:44.880 --> 16:45.720
It is impossible

16:45.720 --> 16:47.120
having a paranoia

16:47.120 --> 16:47.900
You are strong

16:47.900 --> 16:48.740
Four days after

16:48.740 --> 16:49.560
A trauma in the neck

16:49.560 --> 16:50.840
It would be vu otherwise.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.140
It is important that he does not part

16:52.140 --> 16:52.740
as a sprint

16:52.740 --> 16:53.440
but it part

16:53.440 --> 16:54.620
Little Foulée

16:54.620 --> 16:55.140
The Little Running

16:55.140 --> 16:55.740
He knows what he does

16:55.740 --> 16:57.240
I think that he knows what he does

16:57.240 --> 16:57.760
It disappears

16:57.760 --> 16:58.560
He is on a marathon

16:58.560 --> 16:59.180
He wants not to exhaust

16:59.180 --> 16:59.580
It disappears

16:59.580 --> 17:00.020
It is not exhausted

17:00.020 --> 17:00.820
The escalation

17:00.820 --> 17:02.320
The grill

17:02.320 --> 17:03.700
This is the last image

17:03.700 --> 17:03.980
What is a reading

17:03.980 --> 17:04.460
Last image

17:04.460 --> 17:05.240
on le voit s'enfoncer

17:05.240 --> 17:06.360
Flou dans les bois

17:06.360 --> 17:08.360
People have said

17:08.360 --> 17:09.260
This is not just

17:09.260 --> 17:10.140
Someone who has said

17:10.140 --> 17:10.880
Franchise

17:10.880 --> 17:11.940
That a l air really too chiant

17:11.940 --> 17:12.960
It is that the airport

17:12.960 --> 17:13.400
Maybe

17:13.400 --> 17:14.420
From the airport

17:14.420 --> 17:14.980
c is stressful

17:14.980 --> 17:15.400
I know not

17:15.400 --> 17:16.480
I know

17:16.480 --> 17:17.260
I understand this trick

17:17.260 --> 17:18.380
You must take EasyJet

17:18.380 --> 17:20.180
No but for example

17:20.180 --> 17:20.760
on you dit

17:20.760 --> 17:21.960
Oh yeah

17:21.960 --> 17:23.040
You need a supplement

17:23.040 --> 17:23.880
The baggage in soute

17:23.880 --> 17:25.060
You can

17:25.060 --> 17:26.460
There is no one that des films

17:26.460 --> 17:27.220
by Adam Sandler

17:27.220 --> 17:29.340
Here is

17:29.340 --> 17:30.740
on n'a que le dernier

17:30.740 --> 17:31.160
by Adam Sandler

17:31.160 --> 17:31.720
Bon bah tu y vas pas

17:31.720 --> 17:32.580
The course

17:32.580 --> 17:33.680
I am above all

17:33.680 --> 17:34.280
You can say

17:34.280 --> 17:36.860
Theory number 1

17:36.860 --> 17:38.120
It is the theory

17:38.120 --> 17:38.720
The most interesting

17:38.720 --> 17:39.020
I have eu

17:39.020 --> 17:40.140
It is the mec est tombé

17:40.140 --> 17:41.820
by Dealer

17:41.820 --> 17:42.600
Who is forced

17:42.600 --> 17:43.860
to be a mule

17:43.860 --> 17:44.320
You see

17:44.320 --> 17:45.920
It is a panic

17:45.920 --> 17:46.360
but awaits

17:46.360 --> 17:47.220
The baggage on a retrouvé

17:47.220 --> 17:47.680
YES

17:47.680 --> 17:49.380
So that would be all

17:49.380 --> 17:49.740
on him

17:49.740 --> 17:50.080
Yes

17:50.080 --> 17:50.800
Here is

17:50.800 --> 17:52.480
and the people are said

17:52.480 --> 17:52.700
YES

17:52.700 --> 17:53.660
And he would have even

17:53.660 --> 17:54.720
Eclaté a balloon

17:54.720 --> 17:55.600
The Heroes or What

17:55.600 --> 17:56.080
The Son Corps

17:56.080 --> 17:57.200
and it would become paranoid

17:57.200 --> 17:58.980
Sauf that it does not

17:58.980 --> 18:00.220
with his facts and gestures

18:00.220 --> 18:00.480
with

18:00.480 --> 18:01.560
Il allait d'Allemagne

18:01.560 --> 18:02.420
to where?

18:02.420 --> 18:03.500
Il allait d'Autriche

18:03.500 --> 18:03.940
of Hungary

18:03.940 --> 18:05.000
in Germany

18:05.000 --> 18:05.560
C is not there

18:05.560 --> 18:06.400
It is a drug trafficking

18:06.400 --> 18:06.700
by no

18:06.700 --> 18:07.660
On the east pas no plus

18:07.660 --> 18:08.200
in Brazil

18:08.200 --> 18:09.020
or in Colombia

18:09.020 --> 18:09.680
So here is

18:09.680 --> 18:10.340
My question

18:10.340 --> 18:12.120
I have a lot of thought

18:12.120 --> 18:13.260
You see it a tracassé

18:13.260 --> 18:14.840
Because I feel

18:14.840 --> 18:16.640
You say me

18:16.640 --> 18:17.480
The mec

18:17.480 --> 18:18.380
Anyone who

18:18.380 --> 18:19.400
The mec

18:19.400 --> 18:21.820
A completely disparu

18:21.820 --> 18:22.240
in the woods

18:22.240 --> 18:22.760
since

18:22.760 --> 18:23.660
may he listen to us

18:23.660 --> 18:24.340
More than 4 years

18:24.340 --> 18:25.080
If he hears us

18:25.080 --> 18:25.820
Make Signs

18:25.820 --> 18:26.980
It is called Mats

18:26.980 --> 18:27.440
I believe

18:27.440 --> 18:29.520
Do you have notions of German?

18:29.520 --> 18:30.020
I am J

18:30.020 --> 18:30.820
A few notions

18:30.820 --> 18:31.780
I can tell him

18:31.780 --> 18:32.900
Sleeping well

18:32.900 --> 18:33.820
Treumen is sister

18:33.820 --> 18:34.800
It is a dire

18:34.800 --> 18:36.140
in the way you travel

18:36.140 --> 18:37.180
Eat well

18:37.180 --> 18:37.580
made of beurre

18:37.580 --> 18:39.180
and a priori

18:39.180 --> 18:39.800
I think that

18:39.800 --> 18:40.740
I think the message

18:40.740 --> 18:41.260
is past

18:41.260 --> 18:42.660
Mats

18:44.840 --> 18:46.540
It is what he would have pu

18:46.540 --> 18:47.240
The Survivor in Les bois

18:47.240 --> 18:48.640
all alone?

18:48.640 --> 18:49.380
It is that

18:49.380 --> 18:50.900
You will be capable

18:50.900 --> 18:51.360
to do that

18:51.360 --> 18:52.100
to change life

18:52.100 --> 18:52.800
by All Plaquer

18:52.800 --> 18:54.160
I'm going without a bag

18:54.160 --> 18:54.600
Without the fringes

18:54.600 --> 18:55.160
without your phone

18:55.160 --> 18:55.780
without your passport

18:55.780 --> 18:56.120
without anything

18:56.120 --> 18:57.740
and reinvent the way of zero

18:57.740 --> 18:58.800
Is that possible?

18:58.800 --> 18:59.620
Where do you start?

18:59.620 --> 19:00.000
You talk to a mec

19:00.000 --> 19:01.560
Who arrives an hour in advance

19:01.560 --> 19:02.340
for a train

19:02.340 --> 19:03.180
by Clermont-Limoges

19:03.180 --> 19:05.420
I am rather organized

19:05.420 --> 19:06.140
rather not

19:06.140 --> 19:07.280
rather not

19:07.280 --> 19:08.920
Stay in the same way

19:08.920 --> 19:10.380
The same way banal

19:10.380 --> 19:11.220
Sadly

19:11.220 --> 19:12.080
but it is that

19:12.080 --> 19:12.800
It is Rambo

19:12.800 --> 19:14.120
In the forest there?

19:14.120 --> 19:14.760
The question is that

19:14.760 --> 19:15.420
What you think

19:15.420 --> 19:15.800
that le mec

19:15.800 --> 19:16.980
A survivor in the forest?

19:16.980 --> 19:18.460
It is dead of thirst

19:18.460 --> 19:19.800
It is paranoid?

19:19.800 --> 19:20.340
I’m not like

19:20.340 --> 19:21.120
Stories of Mystery

19:21.120 --> 19:21.780
He is dead

19:21.780 --> 19:22.940
Matt is dead

23:59.320 --> 24:00.380
Because that

24:00.380 --> 24:01.540
You see me

24:01.540 --> 24:02.300
I have that passion

24:02.300 --> 24:03.320
for them to escape

24:03.320 --> 24:03.740
for example

24:03.740 --> 24:04.580
Les mecs qui s'enfuient

24:04.580 --> 24:04.920
by Prison

24:04.920 --> 24:05.480

24:18.400 --> 24:18.800

24:29.940 --> 24:31.220
Dancing in one of his jokes

What he always considered

24:33.440 --> 24:34.340
Suicide as an option

24:34.340 --> 24:34.720
that which is true

24:34.720 --> 24:35.400
When a Trick

24:35.400 --> 24:35.840

A History of Family

25:00.960 --> 25:02.100
c is simply

25:02.100 --> 25:02.960
At the end of a moment

25:02.960 --> 25:03.920
The Relais

25:03.920 --> 25:05.320
with the sandwich at 6 euros

25:05.320 --> 25:06.600
Le mec de la douane

25:06.600 --> 25:07.460

The train of train

25:08.360 --> 25:08.940

25:08.940 --> 25:09.780
Finally the aircraft

25:09.780 --> 25:10.140

With this explanation

25:19.720 --> 25:20.480
Reviews of images

25:20.480 --> 25:21.260

A man who says

25:30.000 --> 25:31.020
in the middle of an airport

25:31.020 --> 25:31.820
Because it crosses

25:31.820 --> 25:32.460
In front of airplanes

25:32.460 --> 25:33.320
The guy is crazy anyway

25:33.320 --> 25:34.860

28:49.600 --> 28:50.460

28:50.460 --> 28:51.140
Who makes me sad

28:51.140 --> 28:51.580
in the life

28:51.580 --> 28:52.420
and

28:52.420 --> 28:54.100
The French

28:54.100 --> 28:55.640
and not French

28:55.640 --> 28:56.520
who residents in France

28:56.520 --> 28:57.600

28:57.600 --> 28:57.780
Otherwise

28:57.780 --> 28:58.420
Who must rise

28:58.420 --> 29:00.280
The racism

29:00.280 --> 29:01.580
It is very hard

29:01.580 --> 29:02.760
and two

29:02.760 --> 29:03.300
Really

29:03.300 --> 29:04.140
For the force of seeing

29:04.140 --> 29:04.940
The racists

29:04.940 --> 29:06.520
on Twitter

29:06.520 --> 29:07.060
on the internet

29:07.060 --> 29:07.400
everywhere

29:07.400 --> 29:08.440
The first reaction

29:08.440 --> 29:08.720
c was

29:08.720 --> 29:09.600
They are really cons

29:09.600 --> 29:10.180
These racists

29:10.180 --> 29:10.780
They are evil

29:10.780 --> 29:11.300
I hate them

29:11.300 --> 29:12.240
and a force

29:12.240 --> 29:14.240
I see a true suffering

29:14.240 --> 29:14.860
at these people

29:14.860 --> 29:16.420
and when on est obsédé

29:16.420 --> 29:16.940
at point

29:16.940 --> 29:18.720
When the article

29:18.720 --> 29:19.400
It is on

29:19.400 --> 29:20.780

29:20.780 --> 29:22.240

29:33.540 --> 29:34.740
Enormous work

29:34.740 --> 29:35.180
You know what

29:35.180 --> 29:36.240

29:54.260 --> 29:56.060
What is the exit tax

29:56.060 --> 29:57.540
Macron wants to suppress

29:57.540 --> 29:59.520
It is only

29:59.520 --> 30:00.360
There was no tax

30:00.360 --> 30:01.520

The volcano threat

34:03.440 --> 34:03.820
The island

34:03.820 --> 34:04.760
Where there was the park

34:04.760 --> 34:06.140
Sauf que sur l'île

34:06.140 --> 34:07.100
Living the Dinosaurs

34:07.100 --> 34:07.480
in freedom

34:07.480 --> 34:08.320
and

34:08.320 --> 34:10.480
A company

34:10.480 --> 34:12.100
A Priority

34:12.100 --> 34:13.060
well intended

34:13.060 --> 34:14.620
We will see La Meuf du 1

34:14.620 --> 34:15.240
by Chris Pratt

34:15.240 --> 34:15.720
and he said

34:15.720 --> 34:16.760
They disent

34:16.760 --> 34:17.800
The Ten

34:17.800 --> 34:20.760
The rest of the dinosaurs

34:20.760 --> 34:21.460
Alz les Sauver

34:21.460 --> 34:23.000
Bon

34:23.000 --> 34:24.120
I have found it

34:24.120 --> 34:24.460
very con

34:24.460 --> 34:24.800
Yes

34:24.800 --> 34:25.400
Because that

34:25.400 --> 34:26.460
The Prime Minister was Bête déjà

34:26.460 --> 34:27.540
The Prime Minister was already

34:27.540 --> 34:27.800
by chier

34:27.800 --> 34:28.520
You say OK

34:28.520 --> 34:29.700
Alz les Sauver

34:29.700 --> 34:30.820
Chris Pratt is accepted

34:30.820 --> 34:31.920
They will go on the island

34:31.920 --> 34:32.620
So already

34:32.620 --> 34:34.220
Double threat

34:34.220 --> 34:34.960
The threat

34:34.960 --> 34:36.120
by chute de gravier

34:36.120 --> 34:36.580
and lava

34:36.580 --> 34:37.120
Plus

34:37.120 --> 34:38.600
The Dinosaur

34:38.600 --> 34:39.700
In other words I mettrai

34:39.700 --> 34:40.420
Yes because that

34:40.420 --> 34:41.140
by chute de gravier

34:41.140 --> 34:41.660
is not very

34:41.660 --> 34:43.080
It is not very serious

34:43.080 --> 34:43.800
Picote anyway.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.280
then already

34:44.280 --> 34:46.120
by chute de gravat

34:46.120 --> 34:46.720
You prefer

34:46.720 --> 34:47.480
The Meteor

34:47.480 --> 34:48.380
déjà il y a petite pluie

34:48.380 --> 34:49.240
In addition to it and a des dinos

34:49.240 --> 34:49.640
Therefore

34:49.640 --> 34:51.440
I have no price

34:51.440 --> 34:52.000
The Little Lane

34:52.000 --> 34:53.280
Not good here

34:53.280 --> 34:53.740
but

34:53.740 --> 34:55.240
and it is that

34:55.240 --> 34:56.100
On arrival to point

34:56.100 --> 34:57.020
Who interests me

34:57.020 --> 34:58.240
c is that

34:58.240 --> 34:59.280
They are rewarding vite compte

34:59.280 --> 34:59.900
that

34:59.900 --> 35:01.620
by Chris Pratt

35:01.620 --> 35:03.320
The Son of Dino

35:03.320 --> 35:04.440
You know those to whom

35:04.440 --> 35:04.900
They speak in faisant

35:04.900 --> 35:06.620
with the small machine

35:06.620 --> 35:07.240
The Little Scene

35:07.240 --> 35:07.800
The yes

35:07.800 --> 35:08.960
ridiculously

35:08.960 --> 35:09.340
Brief by

35:09.340 --> 35:11.300
He recovers a

35:11.300 --> 35:12.620
who se bat à ses côtés

35:12.620 --> 35:13.140
Like a dog

35:13.140 --> 35:15.020
That doesn’t shock anyone

35:15.020 --> 35:15.200
OK

35:15.200 --> 35:15.720
but

35:15.720 --> 35:16.960
It makes vite count

35:16.960 --> 35:17.240
that

35:17.240 --> 35:19.600
The company first

35:19.600 --> 35:20.340
Who had requested

35:20.340 --> 35:20.920
by Chercher

35:20.920 --> 35:22.060
Vulait in fact

35:22.060 --> 35:24.040
The mixer of DNA

35:24.040 --> 35:25.000
Fare des croisements

35:25.000 --> 35:26.080
by dino

35:26.080 --> 35:27.360
to do a

35:27.360 --> 35:28.340
More dangerous

35:28.340 --> 35:28.980
who obirait à l'homme

35:28.980 --> 35:30.220
to make a weapon

35:30.220 --> 35:31.800
comment on can do

35:31.800 --> 35:32.180
The question is

35:32.180 --> 35:32.620
This is what we take

35:32.620 --> 35:33.240
for the cons

35:33.240 --> 35:34.780
Really

35:34.780 --> 35:36.060
to 100%

35:36.060 --> 35:36.480
or

35:36.480 --> 35:37.720
What you think

35:37.720 --> 35:38.260
That really

35:38.260 --> 35:39.560
The mec

35:39.560 --> 35:40.860
with a small claque-doigts

35:40.860 --> 35:41.320
and it is all

35:41.320 --> 35:42.620
can lead

35:42.620 --> 35:43.360
The Army of Raptors

35:43.360 --> 35:43.720
and yes

35:43.720 --> 35:45.040
What it serves

35:45.040 --> 35:46.400
Waiting for

35:46.400 --> 35:46.940
You are on the train of me

35:46.940 --> 35:47.480
to complot

35:47.480 --> 35:48.180
It was what they wanted

35:48.180 --> 35:48.980
by Chris Pratt

35:48.980 --> 35:49.580
The assistant

35:49.580 --> 35:51.420
to control their new weapons

35:51.420 --> 35:52.660
by REMENER DES DINO

35:52.660 --> 35:53.620
for that they regain

35:53.620 --> 35:54.080
The tests

35:54.080 --> 35:55.700
Recovery of Mixes

35:55.700 --> 35:56.520
to create

35:56.520 --> 35:57.280
The Last Weapon

35:57.280 --> 35:58.320
But that would be des dino-robots

35:58.320 --> 35:59.100
It would not be des dino

35:59.100 --> 35:59.700
They would have something

35:59.700 --> 36:00.020
in the head

36:00.020 --> 36:00.620
No but that’s the problem

36:00.620 --> 36:01.720
The place of invention

36:01.720 --> 36:02.400
A bomb

36:02.400 --> 36:03.500
MEGA Dangerous

36:03.500 --> 36:05.220
Les mecs se cassent le cul

36:05.220 --> 36:05.980
The mixer

36:05.980 --> 36:07.120
already to baiser

36:07.120 --> 36:07.560
The T-Rex

36:07.560 --> 36:08.240
and a Diplodocus

36:08.240 --> 36:09.460
But to kill who already

36:09.460 --> 36:09.680
to my opinion

36:09.680 --> 36:10.480
On the east on a threat

36:10.480 --> 36:11.860
Global

36:11.860 --> 36:12.700
Saudi Arabia

36:12.700 --> 36:13.040
China

36:13.040 --> 36:14.180
Everything that is not

36:14.180 --> 36:15.860
American

36:15.860 --> 36:17.500
and the coup

36:17.500 --> 36:19.660
The question is rather

36:19.660 --> 36:20.400
What you think

36:20.400 --> 36:21.100
That is worth the coup

36:21.100 --> 36:22.680
D'aller on an island

36:22.680 --> 36:23.780
D’Sayer

36:23.780 --> 36:24.640
to make baiser

36:24.640 --> 36:25.300
Because that already

36:25.300 --> 36:26.500
Fare des croisements

36:26.500 --> 36:27.260
by chevaux

36:27.260 --> 36:27.740
I know not if you see

36:27.740 --> 36:28.320
Who is in the Campaign

36:28.320 --> 36:29.560
It is hyper complicated

36:29.560 --> 36:31.020
You have to excite

36:31.020 --> 36:31.640
A man

36:31.640 --> 36:32.260
The Ethan

36:32.260 --> 36:33.600
The La Genisse

36:33.600 --> 36:34.360
must be

36:34.360 --> 36:34.680
Bon Ouais

36:34.680 --> 36:35.460
It is hyper chiant

36:35.460 --> 36:36.340
They must serve a buffer

36:36.340 --> 36:37.200
You have to put them in music

36:37.200 --> 36:37.840
Not but you see

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
Ouais tu leur mets des bougies

36:38.840 --> 36:40.780
You brings an ethalon

36:40.780 --> 36:42.480
Dancing an Immense Singerue

36:42.480 --> 36:43.360
Then you have to go

36:43.360 --> 36:44.020
Injects this

36:44.020 --> 36:44.860
Bon c is chiant

36:44.860 --> 36:45.960
They make it

36:45.960 --> 36:46.620
You are in train of me

36:46.620 --> 36:47.600
How to try to do

36:47.600 --> 36:49.060
Two dinosaurs gigantic

36:49.060 --> 36:49.900
It must be a bit complicated

36:49.900 --> 36:50.540
YES

36:50.540 --> 36:51.920
They don’t have the same race

36:51.920 --> 36:52.300
attention

36:52.300 --> 36:53.380
c is that

36:53.380 --> 36:54.160
It is a diplodocus

36:54.160 --> 36:54.720
It is a t-rex

36:54.720 --> 36:56.400
I hate you

36:56.400 --> 36:57.560
The Crossing

36:57.560 --> 36:58.920
The Crusades of Dinosaurs

36:58.920 --> 37:01.740
The dinosaurs stay among them.

37:01.740 --> 37:02.360
It is that it is not

37:02.360 --> 37:02.880
A lot of money

37:02.880 --> 37:03.480
Waste for nothing

37:03.480 --> 37:04.000
Here I am simple

37:04.000 --> 37:05.220
You Want Me Answer

37:05.220 --> 37:06.360
I want your answer

37:06.360 --> 37:07.620
It's what you're going to see the movie

37:07.620 --> 37:08.640
No

37:08.640 --> 37:10.300
Bon Bah then

37:10.300 --> 37:11.040
They have no eu reason

37:11.040 --> 37:12.360
That is what you believe

37:12.360 --> 37:13.240
The movie will not walk

37:13.240 --> 37:15.220
This is what le premier a market

37:15.220 --> 37:15.800
I imagine

37:15.800 --> 37:16.900
Bah oui il a tout cassé

37:16.900 --> 37:17.600
Bon Bah Yes

37:17.600 --> 37:18.340
I will walk

37:18.340 --> 37:19.660
He will walk

37:19.660 --> 37:19.980
I think

37:19.980 --> 37:21.160
So they auraient pu faire n'importe quoi

37:21.160 --> 37:23.480
They are going whatever

37:23.480 --> 37:24.860
What is that you

37:24.860 --> 37:25.600
you auriez fait

37:25.600 --> 37:26.720
I'm what I'm aimed

37:26.720 --> 37:27.580
It is an intimist film.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.820
with the dinosaurs

37:28.820 --> 37:29.940
It's what they're safe chercher

37:29.940 --> 37:30.780
Maybe Romer

37:30.780 --> 37:32.760
The Last Godard

37:32.760 --> 37:33.080
You see

37:33.080 --> 37:33.940
Who comes

37:33.940 --> 37:35.220
Who makes you a trick

37:35.220 --> 37:36.140
Where Bon Bah Finally

37:36.140 --> 37:37.880
It is a dinosaur 30 years old.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.620

37:38.620 --> 37:40.880
We will put a little music

37:40.880 --> 37:41.580

37:41.580 --> 37:45.880

37:48.300 --> 37:50.120
Patrick I Want To Leave This Island

37:50.120 --> 37:50.600
