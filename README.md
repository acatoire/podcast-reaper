The repository includes a simple, responsive website for browsing and listening to podcasts:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view available podcasts
2. Click on a podcast to view its episodes
3. Click on an episode to view details and listen to it

### Website Structure

- `index.html` - Main page that lists available podcasts
- `podcast.html` - Podcast detail page that displays episodes and their details
- `styles.css` - Stylesheet for the website
- `podcasts/` - Directory containing podcast data

### Adding a New Podcast to the Website

1. Create a new directory in the `podcasts/` folder with the podcast name (use lowercase and underscores for spaces)
2. Create an `episodes.json` file in the new directory with episode data
3. Add a new podcast card to the `index.html` file

The website is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
